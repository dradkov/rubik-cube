# Rubik cube rotation

Program that simulates a Rubik’s cube. The aim of the program is not to solve the cube, but to simulates a Rubik’s cube rotation.
It Prints the state of the Rubik cube after certian operations.

1. Possible Movements
   - Front Clockwise
   - Front Inverted
   - Left Clockwise
   - Left Inverted
   - Right Clockwise
   - Right Inverted
   - Up Clockwise
   - Up Inverted
   - Down Clockwise
   - Down Inverted
   - Back Clockwise
   - Back Inveted

2. Possible Prints
   - Flat
   - Basic (will be implemented on later state)
  
3. Initial state of the cube is
  - Front - Green
  - Back - Blue
  - Left - Orange
  - Right - Red
  - Up - White
  - Down - Yellow

4. Default movements (functionality to rotate in diferent steps will be implemented)
  - Front Clockwise
  - Right Inverted
  - Up Clockwise
  - Back Inverted
  - Left Clockwise
  - Down inverted
    
5. The result must looks like below

8. Unit tests added

9. Comments: I would improve
  - optimize the logic
  - function to print in difrent shape
  - add more unit tests
  - extract logics in Class Libraries
